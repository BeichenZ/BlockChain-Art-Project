Introduction:

The objective of this project is to build a distributed system in which the peer robts will work
together to map out the area they are in. Each robot will communicate its finding with its
neighbours only when they come within a certain range of other robots within an Ad-hoc network. The robots will
exchange their maps, resolve any conflicts between these maps and its local one, and
coordinate how to explore the undiscovered areas. At the same time, robots will upload the map in consensus to the server(for display only) in the Azure cloud to display the result.
